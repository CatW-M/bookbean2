## Blockers/Future Plans
I was unable to merge my shop and book search by the deadline. I spent the first week of the project creating a shop. When I created the book search, I should have created it as a branch of the original repo, but did not and it caused major problems trying to reconcile the two projects. My original repo can be found here: 
[BookBean]([https://link-url-here.org](https://github.com/CatW-M/BookBean))

Going forward, I would like to add in the shop and also use a scraper to add coffees from local roasters to the database. As I learn more about AI, I would like to create a program that can offer more refined coffee-pairings based on user data.
